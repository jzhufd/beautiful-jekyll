I started to build my own website about one week ago, it takes a lot of searching and comparing effort. 
I am sharing the best practice in my mind in developing you own website. Please find the detailed step-by-step process in the following.
In my opinion, it is a one day project :) Feel free to leave comments at the bottom.

### Use github as the host of the website
1. Register one account at [github.com](https://github.com/)
   * If you are first time to github, please check this nice tutorial video
   {% include youtubePlayer.html id="0fKg7e37bQE&t" %}  

2. Fork one of the existing Jekyll themes from github repository. I used Dean Attali's [_Beautiful Jekyll theme_](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll)
   * Click the link above at go to the repository for _Beautiful Jekyll theme_
   * The Fork button is located at the top right corner (right below your username)  

3. Rename the folder forked as `<username>.github.io`, where the `<username>` is the github user name you registered at step 1
   * Now your website should be running
   * Open a new tab in the web browser; input `https:<username>.github.io` and your own website is there!!

4. Customize the website settings
   * The major custom files are located at `\_config.yml`, `aboutme.md` and files in folder `_posts` 
   * The basic markdown tutorial can be found [here](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)
   * `\_config.yml` has detailed explanation; please go through them line-by-line.

### Personalize your website with your own domain name
1. Register your own domain 
   * Godaddy, namespace and google domain are all available to register your personal domain, _\*.com_ is highly recommended
   * Please do not forget to Google whether there is any coupon available
2. Connect the github website host and your personal domain name. I will use godaddy for example
